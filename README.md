# Drawmation
A drawing application with a twist.  Why not an app that animates as you draw.  I call it, "Dramation"  It was made with Java. Using Processing.  To save your work just press any key.  The file will be labeled, "thing.png" **For best results use a drawing tablet. Mice suck for drawing!

Additionally, I've included an example video of a drawing made in Drawmation.

# Drawmation
A drawing application with a twist.  Why not an app that animates as you draw.  I call it, "Dramation"  It was made with Java. Using Processing.  To save your work just press any key.  The file will be labeled, "thing.png"  For best results use a Wacom Tablet. Mice suck.  Also this would be sweet if the iPad supported Java ;)
